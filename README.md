# BuzzerBee
A simple game generated with the help of GitHub Copilot Agents

The [initial prompt](SpecPrompt.md) used to generate the base game is included in the repository.
However, many of the featured identified in the prompt were either not implemented or implemented
incorrectly by the Agent and have been manually implemented since the game.
